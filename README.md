I developed an AI-based Authenticity Detection prototype designed to support forensic departments in verifying whether digital media is genuine or AI-generated/manipulated. The system analyzes audio, images, and videos to help investigators quickly identify deepfakes or tampered content, which are increasingly common with the rise of generative AI.

For audio analysis, the model examines signal-processing features such as jitter, shimmer, spectral patterns, and voice inconsistencies. For images and videos, the system checks visual artifacts, frame-level anomalies, metadata patterns, and deepfake indicators. After processing the uploaded file, the platform generates a clear forensic-style report displaying the authenticity prediction, confidence score, and key factors that influenced the result.

The prototype features a simple and user-friendly interface where users can upload media files and instantly view the analysis report, making it suitable for real-world investigative workflows.

This project was developed during a hackathon to demonstrate the practical application of AI in digital forensics. The complete source code, documentation, and setup instructions are available on GitHub, enabling easy access, collaboration, and further enhancement of the project.
