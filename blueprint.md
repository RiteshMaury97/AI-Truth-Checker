# AI Deepfake Detector Blueprint

## Overview

This application is a web-based tool for detecting deepfakes in images and videos. Users can upload files, and the application will analyze them using a deep learning model to determine if they have been manipulated.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Framework:** Next.js with Tailwind CSS
*   **Layout:** A simple, clean layout with a navigation bar, a main content area, and a footer.
*   **Color Scheme:** A modern color scheme with a dark navigation bar and footer, and a light main content area.
*   **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts.

### Features

*   **File Upload:** Users can upload image and video files.
*   **Deepfake Analysis:** The application will use a deep learning model to analyze the uploaded files for signs of manipulation.
*   **Result Display:** The application will display the results of the analysis, including a determination of whether the file is a deepfake and a confidence score.

## Current Plan

The project has been structured with a `src` directory, and the Next.js App Router is now located in `src/app`. The directory structure is as follows:

*   `src/app`: for application routes.
*   `src/components`: for reusable UI components.
*   `src/services`: for API and other services.
*   `src/utils`: for utility functions.
*   `src/assets`: for static assets like images and fonts.
*   `src/styles`: for global styles.

This corrected structure aligns with Next.js best practices and provides a solid foundation for future development.
